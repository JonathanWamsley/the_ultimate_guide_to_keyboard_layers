# 2.2 Firmware

> The firmware of a keyboard is what runs on the board's microcontroller, reading the keyboard matrix and sending the scancodes for pressed keys to the computer. When a keyboard is backlit the LEDs are typically controlled by the firmware as well.  - /r [mk firmware wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/firmware#wiki\_firmware\_wiki)

Some ergo keyboards don't easily expose firmware, others do. QMK is by far the most popular firmware for keyboards. Most ergo keyboards use QMK or have their own forked version.
