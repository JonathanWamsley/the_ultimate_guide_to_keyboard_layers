# 4.2 Implementing Layers

### Creating Layers on Keyboard Software

Each keyboard will have their own software interface to create layers. There are likely software specific tutorials that will be more effective than this section.

For most keyboard layout editors, a key can be selected and then a keycode or keycodes with a modifier like command + c can be applied.

Layers can be applied by selecting a key, navigating to a layer selection field and applying the layer type. There should be a choice between different layers activators like toggle or momentary layers though they may have a different name. The first layer is either a 0 or 1 and is usually the default layer. Then if you create a numpad layer on layer 3, then you can select a layer activator from the default layer to go to layer 3.

Your software may also have a way to add macros. To create a macro, a series of key codes are applied that may have modifiers held down at the same time. The macros usually can have a name, be saved and used.

The figure shows a the keyboard where individual keys can be selected. Then the key can have key code, macro or a layer assigned to it.

### Creating Layers using independent software

In Karabiner-Elements, a key remap can be done by selecting a "From key" and a "To key". Personally, I like edit the json file directly that stores karabiner config. This can be found in the misc tab, under \`Export & Import\` section. [Chapter 6 ](broken-reference)on layer examples shows some use cases.

#### Keyboard Maestro

This is an example of creating a macro in keyboard maestro. When I first got my mac, I created an editing/navigation layer. Here is an example of a macro that creates a new line below the cursor. The key key is triggered when option F is pressed. Then the end key stroke is typed followed by the return key.&#x20;



#### Auto Hotkeys

```
!f::SendInput {End}{enter}
```

This is part of an ahk snippet to that creates a macro to create a new line below using alt + f. I have not actually done an application layer yet in ahk since I no longer use windows.
