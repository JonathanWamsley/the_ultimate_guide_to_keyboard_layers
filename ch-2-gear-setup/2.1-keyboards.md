# 2.1 Keyboards

There are a number of popular ergokeyboards. Ergo keyboards generally can

* split apart
* have rgb backlit keys
* can be tilted at an angle
* have additional keys on the thumb region (creating a thumb cluster)
* have an wrist/palm rest aligned with the keyboard
* have a firmware/software to configure keyboard layers
* have alternative layouts (not staggered, but column staggered )

The main con of an ergo keyboard is that it is pricey and you have to learn touch typing properly to hit keys like b, y or 6.

An ergo keyboard is not strictly necessary to create keyboard layers. I was actually using layers with just software (auto hotkeys for windows | keyboard maestro for mac) and had a navigation, number layer and an additional navigation layer that I called hyper nav at the time. To do this though, I had to remap a key like the left command/alt key next to the space bar. If you have the funds and are on the computer for hours a day, I would highly recommend an ergo keyboard.
