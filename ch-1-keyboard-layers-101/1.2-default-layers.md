# 1.2 Layers

Layer activators allow more keyboard layers to be accessible which allow for more key codes. There are several types of layer activators besides the shift and caps lock key that will be explored in Chapter 3. Chapter 4-6 we will explore how to create layers and advance tips and tricks that will make learning them easier in chapter 7. And finally,  chapter 8 shows examples of my layers with code to copy.

Keyboard layers typically have a theme and several patterns within them. The shift layer can have pattern from one layer to the next or within the layer itself. For example, from the default layer to the shift layer all the alphabet keys are in the same position, just uppercase. This is so intuitive that key caps only print a single alphabet key on them. An example of patterns within a layer is the `<` `>` signs and the `{` `}` brackets being next to each other. Having patterns makes learning layers faster and it takes less processing time to execute keystrokes because the layout is intuitive.

If you interchange a qwerty, colemak or dvorak uppercase layer from its default layer, then the user is going to have a mental gymnastics battle typing uppercase letters. ðŸ¤£

Another common layer is the numpad layer that creates number keys on the alphabet keys. This is inspired by the numpad, which fullsize keyboard users may have built muscle memory on. The numpad layer can be required or to provide additional utility. Custom keyboards that are 40% in size are missing a number row and therefore are required to have a number layer to type numbers. Layouts with number rows may still use a number layer because it is arguably easier to type multiple numbers in a row with one hand. This layer therefore provides additional utility.

Info: If a numpad layer is used, then other numbers keys can be repurposed!
