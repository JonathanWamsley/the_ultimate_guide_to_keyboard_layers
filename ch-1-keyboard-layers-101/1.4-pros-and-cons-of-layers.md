# 1.3 Pros Layers

1. allow for keyboards with less keys
   1. 40%  and <% keyboards are allowed to exist&#x20;
2. improve ergonomics = comfort
   1. hight priority keys can be placed near your finger tips using layers
   2. similar keys can be logically grouped next to each together
   3. complex key combinations can be created as a single key code
      1. example, chrome tab left and right
3. improve workflow = productivity
   1. with added key codes at your finger tips you can work faster
      1. thought experiment of hitting n and backspace or reaching control + t
   2. use application keyboard shortcuts in a logically structured layer faster

Danger: if you want to feel discomfort, try hitting the n to backspace key 5 times in a row and the ctrl to t key 5 times in a row with only your left hand
