# 1.1 Keyboard Fundamentals

A keyboard is an arrangement of keys that when pressed or tapped sends a key code to a keyboard driver. Key codes are all the keys like Alphanumeric(a, b, 1, 2), modifier(ctrl, alt/option), cursor(arrow keys) and many more. All these keys form a keyboard layout that represents the key and position. There are some common layouts that even have names such as qwerty, colemak, and dvorak that rearrange keys.

The goal of a keyboard is to be an input device to communicate information to your computer. A problem arises when each key has a single key code. Either you need to create a keyboard as shown below or you can use layer activators which are keycodes like the shift and caplock keys. These layer activators move between keyboard layouts or in other-words, cause the alphabet keys to become uppercase and the numbers and symbols to change too.

To make it easier to communicate these keyboard layouts, we instead give it a description word followed by layer. So the starting layout is called the default layer or base layer and the keyboard layout containing uppercase letters is called the shift, upper or caps layer.

Together, all these keyboard layouts or layers create a collection called a keymap. Keymaps can be stored and shared so other people can easily try new keymaps.
