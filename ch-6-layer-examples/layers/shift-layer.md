# Shift Layer

The shift layer is different from holding down the shift key, which may sound confusing at first. This is because if a default layer has a key that is changed to a superkey or even another key like `!`, then there is no key code mapping defined for shift+superkey or shift+!. So all the uppercase alphabet characters and other symbols have to be set for a custom shift layer.

The nice thing about having a custom shift layer is that more superkeys or nested layers can be added. Below is an example of a shift layer using the qwerty layout with superkeys.
