# Context Control / Macro Layer

For context control, there are 2 main shortcuts. Switching between different applications which can be done natively on mac with `cmd+tab` and switching between multiple versions of an application with `cmd+tilda`.

I use [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) and have a modifier layer(meh) set to the caps lock key to trigger commands. Within keyboard maestro, it has its own application switch that I find more visually pleasing. I activate switching applications with caps+d and between the same applications with caps+f.

### Paste Previous Clipboard Macro

This has saved me many times and allows me to more easily switch content in two different locations. I added this macro to the [editing/navigation layer](editing-and-navigating-layer.md) on the "b" key near the paste.&#x20;

### Pomodoro Timer

I use this all the time. I have a pomo timer that allows you to specify a time, then and optional parameters. Then after the timer ends, a prompt will appear. At a later date, I'll share the full application that sends user data to a log file. I would like to have some nice visuals using this data, but have not had the motivation / time to implement that functionality yet.

### Hot strings

Hot strings are just a series of characters typed. I have a couple of them that are custom to individuals like emails or work related strings. An example of a common string I use is `http://localhost:` that can be done with the code below.

### Automatically trigger applications, macros or scripts

If you want to trigger applications, macros, or scripts at a certain time or on start, then the code block below can be useful.
