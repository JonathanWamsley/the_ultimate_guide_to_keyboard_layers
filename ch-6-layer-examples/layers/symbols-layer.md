# Symbols Layer

Symbol layer was for commonly used programming symbols such as thought shown in the table below. I have decided to deprecated it because I see [tap-dance / super keys](../../ch-3-layer-activators/3.6-tap-dance-super-keys.md) being a superior alternative.&#x20;

Super keys are great because they allow for 3 keys to be combined into single key. This means that instead of splitting symbols between the default, shift and symbols layer instead they can all fit into 1 or 2 layers. For this reason I placed this table in the symbols layer to organize symbols super key usage and because they can exist in either the default or shift layer depending on the users needs.

In VS code and i suspect other editors, when an opening bracket or parentheses is used, then a matching closing symbol is automatically behind the cursor. So you are editing content within the bracket and never have to type out the closing symbol. This means the frequency of opening brackets is much higher than closing and by combining them into a super key, 2 adjacent keys can be combined into 1.
