# 7.2 Creating a Color System

Learning layers can be hard because you can not look at keycaps to determine the keys output. There is however a way to help create reference markers using LED colors.&#x20;

To determine what layer you are on, the keyboard can have a single color theme. The under-glow or the outer keys(if you have extra) can be set to a unique color making it clear which layer you are on.&#x20;

To determine key locations, each key can be mapped to an action type that has an associated color. Key codes are often common actions, and these actions can be loosely associated with colors. Below shows how I mapped each action to a color.

| Action                     | Color        |
| -------------------------- | ------------ |
| Creating / Faster          | Green        |
| Deleting / Slower          | Read         |
| Navigating                 | Cyan         |
| Moving                     | Orange       |
| Searching                  | Yellow       |
| Modifiers                  | Purple       |
| Larger                     | Blue         |
| Smaller                    | Pink         |
| Select / Expand            | Light Blue   |
| Macros                     | Light Purple |
| Actions Items (not listed) | White        |
| Other                      | Off White    |
