# Overview

To be more productive, keyboard shortcuts are commonly used. But to use those keyboard shortcuts, you have to use unintuitive key combinations with modifiers that contort your hands in uncomfortable positions. Keyboard layers solves both of these problems and provide an abstract layering to help organize keyboard shortcuts in an intuitive and ergonomic way.

Hello, my name is Jon and I am a software engineer that uses **keyboard layers** to improve my **workflow** and **ergonomics**. I have been creating keyboard layers since 2020 and use [15 layers](broken-reference) regularly. I created _**The Ultimate Guide to Keyboard Layers**_ to collect my thoughts on layers and share what I have learnt on my [keyboard journey](resources/my-timeline.md).

As early as middle school, I was playing an mmorpg and used over 30 skills, equipment and items in skill lots, which is a bar to assign skills to F-keys, letters and numbers. I competed in lots of person versus person(PVP) competitions and had to be efficient at hit keys quickly and by situation. Additionally, there are classes like assassins, paladins, mages, etc with counter match ups. So if I lose to an undesirable matchup, then I can switch classes, which I had 12 of. In order to quickly learn and switch between different classes, common pairing of skills, equipment and gear were kept at specific locations. Other class specific skills would follow arrangements like having movement abilities on the same key, or having combo skills near each other. This is essentially just like creating keyboard layers, where each character class is like another software application and why I believe layers come more naturally to me.&#x20;
