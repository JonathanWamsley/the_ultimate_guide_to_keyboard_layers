# Overview

Hello, my name is Jon and I am a software engineer that uses **keyboard layers** to improve my **workflow** and **ergonomics**. I have been creating layers since 2020 and use [15 layers](ch-8-contributed-layers/users-layers/jons-layers/) regularly. I created _**The Ultimate Guide to Keyboard Layers**_ to collect my thoughts on layers and share what I have learnt on my [keyboard journey](ch-8-contributed-layers/users-layers/jons-layers/my-timeline.md).

I hope you enjoy this guide, star this [project](https://github.com/JonathanWamsley/ultimate\_keyboard\_layers\_guide) and use the comment system if you have any questions.
