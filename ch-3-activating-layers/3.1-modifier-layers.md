# 3.1 Modifier Layers

A modifier layer is when a key is held, it will activate one or more modifiers like shift, control, option, and command for (mac) or shift control  alt, windows for windows. New key codes can then be defined using a modifier + a default layer key, creating a layer.

Because many applications will use 1 or 2 modifiers for shortcuts, often modifier layers use 3 or more modifiers. The two most popular are the **Meh key** which is the left control, (alt/option), shift and the **Hyper Key** which is left control, (alt/option), shift (command/windows).&#x20;



Modifier layers are a great entry point for layers because they can be done with only software. My first layer used auto hotkeys that modified the left alt key into a hyper key. This allowed me to create a navigation layer by then redefining hyper  j, i, k, l keys into arrow keys.



Many applications can also detect the difference between a left and right modifier. That makes 8 total modifiers, which create a total of 56 unique different combinations if we want 3 modifiers to be held. This means that if you can define the hotkey mapping for an application, then you can create a keyboard layer that is the standard qwerty layer + a modifier combination. This may seem confusing or unintuitive, but doing this helps you organize, learn and maintain the layer.
