# 3.3 Shift Layers

A switch activator switches a layer like the shift key. The layer switches to another layer when held down, and then when released will go back to the original layer. Switched activated layers let you redefine each key without enforcing modifiers.

Switch activated layers are often used by beginners starting out and later swapped to either a one shot or dual activated layers.
