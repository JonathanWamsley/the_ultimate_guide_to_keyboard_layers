# 5.3 Thumb Keys

I decided to write a section on thumb keys because of how important thumb keys are in enabling layers. If you don't use thumb keys, then you have to resort to a layer like the shift key or the other modifier keys. If you hold down one of those keys, then you have to bend your wrist making it less ergonomical. And because the thumb or pinky has to be held down, this creates a restriction in motion making keys like `T` harder to tap.

Even if you have 10 thumb keys, this does not mean they are all usable. Each user will find some thumb keys more comfortable than others. There are also multiple places of contact on the thumb unlike the other fingers. Below I show how 2 of the keys I hit with the side of my thumb, one with the tip of the thumb and the other with the knuckle.

Note, the tip of the thumb is the least comfortable key for me to hit, that is why I assign the lest important role to that key
