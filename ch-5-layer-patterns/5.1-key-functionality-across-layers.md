# 5.1 Key Functionality Across Layers

When you look at a collection of layers, you will notice similar patterns between them. These patterns are usually navigate, move, create, delete, search, go faster, go slower, make larger and make slower actions. These are so prevalent that I even color coded these actions in the next section. The idea is then to have similar actions can be placed on the same key across different layers. So for example left movement is commonly on the j key. This pattern is repeated on [editing/navigating](../ch-7-layer-examples/layers/editing-and-navigating-layer.md), [mouse](../ch-7-layer-examples/layers/mouse-layer.md), [vs code editor](../ch-7-layer-examples/layers/vs-code-layer.md), [vs code terminal](../ch-7-layer-examples/layers/vs-code-layer.md), [browser](../ch-7-layer-examples/layers/browser-layer.md), and [slack](../ch-7-layer-examples/layers/slack-layer.md) layers as shown below.

|                          |                         |   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | - |
| editing/navigating layer | left arrow              | j |
| mouse layer              | left cursor movement    | j |
| vs code editor           | move to left editor tab | j |
| vs code terminal         | terminal focus previous | j |
| browser                  | scroll left             | j |
| slack                    | go back to last group   | j |

When you have established patterns, then this makes creating new layouts easier because you can follow the same pattern depending on the action. This also makes learning the new layer easier as well since the actions are shared across many layers.
