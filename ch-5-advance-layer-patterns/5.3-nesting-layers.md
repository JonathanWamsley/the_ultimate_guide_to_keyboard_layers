# 5.4 Nesting Layers

Layers that require more than one layer to activate are called nested layers. For example, I have a mouse layer that I activate with my right thumb and then within the mouse layer I can use my left thumb to activate my screen manipulation layer(left keyboard side) and media layer(right keyboard side). The screen and media layers are therefore nested layers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Notice the "Shift 8"  on the bottom to move to the screen manipulation / media layer
{% endhint %}

Nested layers should be avoided early on until you have a good understanding of which keys are most ergonomic and can be quickly layered upon. Most nested layers are used with 2 different thumb keys from my experience.
