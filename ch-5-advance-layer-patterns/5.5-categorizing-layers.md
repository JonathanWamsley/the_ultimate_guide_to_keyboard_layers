# 5.5 Categorizing Layers

Layers can be categorized into 3 types; Root, Application and System layers.

### Root Layer

The root layers is the starting point to get to most other layers. This is typically the [default layer](../ch-6-layer-examples/layers/default-layer.md) but can also be a [gaming layer](../ch-6-layer-examples/layers/gaming-layer.md) that has additional game specific layers. In the root layer, you want to be able to easily access all other layers.

### Application Layers

An application layer is a layer that can be used for multiple applications such as a [VS code](../ch-6-layer-examples/layers/vs-code-layer.md), [discord](../ch-6-layer-examples/layers/discord-layer.md), [slack](../ch-6-layer-examples/layers/slack-layer.md) and a [browser](../ch-6-layer-examples/layers/browser-layer.md) layer. At anyone time, there will only be 1 application in front, which means hotkeys can be reused if they are all map to the same key output. For example, a hyper key(all modifiers)+j can be used that will be triggered differently if VS code is in front versus a browser layer.&#x20;

An application layer can be created using Karabiner-Elements, Keyboard Maestro or Auto Hotkeys. The software is application aware meaning they can read the front most application and apply logic on which hotkey to trigger, allowing several layers to exist in one application layer.

So this is how the process works, in your keyboard software/firmware you can create an a layer full of hyper keys, a modifier layer. Then in karabiner-elements, for each hyperkey you can trigger an application specific shortcut. Below is an example that shows how slack, discord, chrome, and vs code(vs code uses the exact hyper keys) hotkey can be trigged and will have different outputs depending on the frontmost application.

An application layer acts as a giant switch or if/else statement.

{
    "manipulators": [
        {
            "conditions": [
                {
                    "bundle_identifiers": [
                        "^com\\.tinyspeck\\.slackmacgap"
                    ],
                    "type": "frontmost_application_if"
                }
            ],
            "description": "slack jump to a conversation",
            "from": {
                "key_code": "k",
                "modifiers": {
                    "mandatory": [
                        "shift",
                        "command",
                        "option",
                        "control"
                    ]
                }
            },
            "to": [
                {
                    "key_code": "k",
                    "modifiers": [
                        "command"
                    ]
                }
            ],
            "type": "basic"
        }
    ]
},

```

Notice how each "from" key is hyper+k key. Then each condition has a different "bundle\_identifiers" that look for specific programs. And finally, the "to" is mapped to a hotkey for the application.

### System Layers

System layers are layers that you will want to access within any application. They require a dedicated layer and should not be made into an application layer because you would want to use a system layer while another application layer is in front.

Some examples of system layers are [shift](../ch-6-layer-examples/layers/shift-layer.md),[ numpad](../ch-6-layer-examples/layers/numpad-layer.md), [media](../ch-6-layer-examples/layers/media-layer.md), [mouse](../ch-6-layer-examples/layers/mouse-layer.md) and [screen manipulation](../ch-6-layer-examples/layers/screen-management-layer.md) layers
