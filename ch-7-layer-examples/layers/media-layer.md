# Media Layer

The media layer is commonly used to adjust audio setting. I frequent youtube (yt) quite often and have common shortcuts available on the same layer. Because this is more of an occasional use layer, not one that I will be constantly switching to I have it as a nested layer with 5 thumb keys being used.
