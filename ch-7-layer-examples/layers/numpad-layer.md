# Numpad Layer

A numpad layer is a rather simple idea. Instead of using the numbers across the entire single row of a keyboard, to instead activate a layer key that creates a virtual numpad. A numpad is a matrix like configuration as seen in the image below. If the keyboard in on a staggered layout, then the numpad use will take a little bit of time to get used to.

Depending on your use case, you may want additional symbols that are commonly associated with numbers nearby such as arithmetic, dashes, or commas. Some numpad layers start on the bottom row near the qwerty n for 0 and m 1. Others start a the row above it so the 789 aligns up with the default 789.

Below are 2 example configurations for a numpad layer. If you go with the first layout, then I suggest having the layer activator on the left hand side, as keeping the thumb planted limits movement and comfort. Often, I only use the first couple numbers, which is why I use something close to the first image. If you use numbers quite frequently, then also having a toggle layer   makes sense.&#x20;
