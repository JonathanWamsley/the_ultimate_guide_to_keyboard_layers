# Screen Management Layer

A screen management layer is used to move applications around a screen or different monitors. I use this fairly often but usually only when I am starting an application. For this reason I have it as a nested layer requiring 2 thumb keys to activate.

For screen management, I use [spectacle](https://rectangleapp.com/), but the latest supported version is [rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/). spectacle allows the screen to be divided into sections and has the ability to move applications to different monitors. Rectangle has very similar functionality with a couple extra features that I don't need yet. features like the ability to split screen in 6 sections, or screens into fourths.
