# Context Control / Macro Layer

For context control, there are 2 main shortcuts. Switching between different applications which can be done natively on mac with `cmd+tab` and switching between multiple versions of an application with `cmd+tilda`.

I use [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) and have a modifier layer set to the caps lock key to trigger commands. Within keyboard maestro, it has its own switch application that is slightly smaller than the default that I like more visually. I activate switching applications with caps+d and between the same applications with caps+f.

on the default profile I have an alternative that has the command and tab in an easily accessible location.
