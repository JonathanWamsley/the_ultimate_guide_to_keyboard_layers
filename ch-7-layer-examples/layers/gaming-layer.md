# Gaming Layer

This layer is a standard qwerty layer that may have some alterations. If modifiers are used in the game then they can be brought to the thumb cluster. If the F-keys are used, then you will likely have to use a layer to get to them quickly or do a total remap of keys. A discord talk to speech trigger can also be made into the caps key or a thumb button.
