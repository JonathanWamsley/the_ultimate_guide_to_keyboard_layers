# 3.4 One Shot Layers

A one shot layer is like a toggle layer except it only last for one keystroke. So if you are in your default layer, you activate a oneshot layer, move to another layer, tap a single key in that layer, then go back to default layer.

Personally, I have not found a good use case for one shot layers yet. This is because I think layers should be divided by themes, where layer keys may be pressed multiple times. This makes one shot layers awkward to use because you would have to activate a one shot layer hit a key, then activate the one shot layer again and hit a key repeatedly which a momentary or dual layer can do a better job of.
