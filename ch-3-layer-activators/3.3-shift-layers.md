# 3.2 Momentary Layers

A momentary activator switches the layer state to another layer similar to how the shift key works. The layer switches to another layer when held down, and then when released will go back to the original layer. Momentary activated layers let you redefine each key without using modifiers.

Momentary activators are great when you want to use another layer for a couple of keystrokes then go back to the original layer. Momentary activated layers are often used by beginners starting out and later swapped to dual activated layers.
